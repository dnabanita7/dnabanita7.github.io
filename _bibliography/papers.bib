  abstract={This paper scrutinizes the reproducibility of VL-SAT and multimodal learning systems for 3D semantic scene graph prediction. Leveraging visual (ViT, CLIP) and linguistic semantics, our study replicates top-k accuracy results and explores models like SGFN, and SGGPoint. We assess the impact of the CLIP adapter, 2D image semantics, and conduct hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, the ablation study investigates node and edge collaboration, and the influence of a multi-head self-attention network within the VL-SAT architecture, enhancing understanding of these critical components.}

  abstract={Cloud forensics is the application of digital forensics in cloud computing as a subset of network forensics to gather and preserve evidence that's suitable for presentation during a court of law. Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you'll access technology services, like computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider. In this report, we present detailed research to investigate the issues in forensics relating to cloud computing and present possible solutions.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
