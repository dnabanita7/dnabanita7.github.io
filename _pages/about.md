As an independent researcher, my primary interests encompasses **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), 3D Reconstruction, 3D Scene Understanding, and SIM2REAL** applications within the field of **quadruped robots**.

I was working as a R&D engineer at [Recherche Antimodular](https://antimodular.com/) and as a developer at [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/).

I have a passion for sharing knowledge and insights, which is why I regularly craft blog posts aimed at elucidating complex topics and making them accessible to a wider audience. Through my writing, I strive to demystify concepts and foster understanding. You can find my blog posts covering a range of subjects on platforms like **LinkedIn**, where I delve into my areas of interest including **reinforcement learning, large language models, photogrammetry, and differential privacy**. Feel free to explore and engage with my content as I continue to contribute to the discourse.

I welcome discussions on potential collaborations and am open to exploring new ideas. If you're interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to reach out via **email** or **discord**!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
