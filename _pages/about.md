I am working on task/motion planning problems under the supervision of Prof. K Madhava Krishna at RRC lab, IIIT Hyderabad, India.

My primary interests encompasses **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), 3D Reconstruction, 3D Scene Understanding, and SIM2REAL** applications within the field of **quadruped robots**.

Collaborations
========
I delve into other areas including **reinforcement learning, large language models, photogrammetry, and differential privacy**.
I welcome discussions on potential collaborations and am open to exploring new ideas. If you're interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to reach out via **email** or **discord**!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
